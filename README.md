# Arvy's Apples :deciduous_tree: :apple: :apple:
## Overview
The Orchard is a small low-poly survival game built in Unity. The game starts in an empty apple orchard.
Pretty much, you have to pass the Test that you didn't know you signed up for when you applied to Arvy's Apples(TM). Remember to stay alive by eating apples and drinking from a river!

The game grows more intense and weird as you get closer to escaping the orchard.

## Download
It's free (and open source)! Check out the [latest release](https://github.com/clabe45/the-orchard/releases/latest)!
