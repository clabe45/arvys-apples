# The Orchard :deciduous_tree: :apple: :apple:
## Overview
The Orchard is a small low-poly survival game built in Unity. The game starts in an empty apple orchard.
You have to live off the land by eating apples and drinking from a river. 
The game grows more intense and weird as you get closer to escaping the orchard.
